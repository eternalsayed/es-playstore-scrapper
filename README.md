NodeJS package to scrap basic information about an app from the Google Playstore. It does so by fetching the page html through request module and then parsing it using the cheerio package.

## Usage
    const esPlayScrapper = require('es-playstore-scrapper');
    esPlayScrapper.getPackageInfo('com.facebook.katana', (err, result) => {
      err ?console.log('Failed with error: ', err) :console.log('Result: ', result);

## Notes
This is a WIP so please beware if using for production. I created this small script because `google-play-scraper` has started failing for me and I needed to get current app version for my app for automated scripts.

## PRs
Pull requests are welcome. Let me know if I can improve it for you!
